# Passive-Smart-Battery-Management-Systems
Passive Balancing BMS model built in Simulink for a 6-cell Li-ion battery pack. Includes SOC estimation via Coulomb counting, voltage modeling using OCV-SOC lookup and internal resistance, temperature dynamics, and hysteresis-based balancing logic. Provides cell voltage, SOC, temperature, and balance command outputs.
